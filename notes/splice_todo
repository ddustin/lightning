- move channel into stfu mode ✅
-- fail if already in stfu mode ✅
-- handle simultaneously stfu conflict (both are intiator) ✅
- send splice ✅
- negotiate the tx ✅
	- reuse the interactive transaction building messages (init_rbf -> ) ✅
- on reconnect, restart ✅
- audit memory usage ✅
- tx_complete rcvd, validate splice tx as dual open does ✅
- tx_complete rcvd, validate splice tx conforms to splice spec
- tx-sigs are exchanged... move out of stfu mode ✅
-- (intiator side) ✅
-- (ack side) ✅
- confirm signed splice tx sigs are valid
-- (intiator side) ✅
-- (ack side)
- broadcast signed splice tx
-- (initiator side)
-- (ack side)
- on reconnect, handle re-transmission of tx-sigs
- normal channel operation; 
	- every commit_sigs, send commitment signatures for splice tx as well
	- bound the amount to route to the new splice amounts (min inprogress balance)
- splice_locked sent + rcvd;
	- clear out all inflight splice txs
	- delete all commitment_sig data related to it
	- update funding tx to be new thing whatever
- go back to "normal" channel operation (no extra commit_sigs or splice amount checks)
