- move channel into stfu mode; fail if already in stfu mode
- send splice 
- negotiate the tx 
	- reuse the interactive transaction building messages (init_rbf -> )
- on reconnect, restart
- tx_complete rcvd, validate splice tx
- tx-sigs are exchanged... move out of stfu mode
- broadcast signed splice tx
- on reconnect, handle re-transmission of tx-sigs
- normal channel operation; 
	- every commit_sigs, send commitment signatures for splice tx as well
	- bound the amount to route to the new splice amounts (min inprogress balance)
- splice_locked sent + rcvd;
	- clear out all inflight splice txs
	- delete all commitment_sig data related to it
	- update funding tx to be new thing whatever
- go back to "normal" channel operation (no extra commit_sigs or splice amount checks)
